The Ender Relay is a new block to finalize the trilogy of the Intentional Game Design: Bed, Respawn Block and, now, Ender Relay

This mod add a single block with an interesting features:
- The Ender Relay is a block teleporting you
  - craft: 4 obsidian, 4 popped chorus, 1 enderpearl
  - it can be loaded like the respawn anchor with End Chrystal, but it can only contain 2 charges instead of the Respawn Anchor's 4
  - you can set a location with a lodestone compass
  - when right-clicking with an empty hand you will be teleported next to the lodestone your compass is linked to
  - when shift right-clicking you'll be displayed the coordinates of the lodestone, you can replace this coordinates by a custom name by renaming the lodestone compass you set the location with
